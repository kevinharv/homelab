# Development Virtual Workstation

*I'm tired of having two computers, neither truly Linux. Time to remote into a development box.*

## Overview

Create Ubuntu 25.04 (for now) virtual development workstation with RDP enabled. Build from ISO with Packer against Proxmox. Provision with Terraform. Post-provisioning configuration and lifecycle management with Ansible. This might be a trial for dual booting or solely running Linux when Windows 10 goes EoL.
